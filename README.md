## Overview
Our project is a story based game taht follows the CS50 duck on an adventure. More details in the DEGISN.md file

## How to Start
The game starts by running the python file main.py.

It will start by opening a new pygame window with the game visuals therein. 

## Controls
The keyboard controls for gameplay are as follows:

Trackpad: Aims the player's bullets
Single-click: Player shoots a bullet in the direction of the mouse

ArrowKeys:
\[D\]: Move the player to the right
\[A\]: Move the plater to the left
\[W\]: Move the player up (jump)


## Playing

Basic game fundamentals: 
- The goal of most levels is to reach the portal, not to kill all the enemies (exception of story slides and the boss level)
- Questions are answered by passing through the corresponding portal
- Answering a question wrong will send the player back 1 level
- Blocks (black rectangles) are impassable by the player
- When the player dies, the whole game is restarted

## Quitting
Depending on the operating system; the window can be closed like any other window. On mac, use CMD+Q or the red x. On Windows, use ALT+F4.
